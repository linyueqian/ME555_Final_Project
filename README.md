#### Final Project of ME555

## Introduction

This project focuses on training Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to detect and appropriately respond to unsolvable robotic tasks. Using a combination of synthetic data generation and fine-tuning techniques, we develop a model that can effectively identify when a requested task is beyond a robot's capabilities and provide clear explanations for why the task cannot be performed.

### Key Features
- Synthetic data generation for unsolvable robotic tasks
- Fine-tuned LLaVA model for task feasibility detection
- Clear explanation generation for unsolvable tasks
- Support for both SD and Habitat-generated scenarios

## Dataset

Download our synthetic dataset from: [Box](https://duke.box.com/s/w5u131acn89zr110dn77r39h2ubemnll)

### Dataset Structure
```
- sd_images: the SD dataset generated by SD
    - generated_tasks.jsonl: the text of the robot responses explaining task limitations
    - images: the images generated by SD

- habitat_images: the Habitat dataset generated by Habitat Simulator
    - generated_tasks.jsonl: the text of the robot responses explaining task limitations
    - images: the images generated by Habitat Simulator
``` 

## Model Checkpoints

Download our fine-tuned model weights from: [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/linyueqian/ME555_llava_v1.5_finetuned)

Base model: LLaVA-1.5-7B

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
bash
git clone https://github.com/linyueqian/ME555_Final_Project
cd ME555_Final_Project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

To run inference with our fine-tuned model:
```bash
python inference.py
```

This will load the model, process the input, and generate the output.

## Generate Synthetic Data

To generate synthetic data:
```bash
python task_generation/generate.py
python image_generation/generate.py
```

This will generate the synthetic data and save it to the specified output file.
